**BakalariDesktop** is a fast, efficient, and performance-driven desktop application for the Bakalari school system.
Designed to outperform the web-based interface,
BakalariDesktop offers a smoother and more powerful experience tailored specifically for desktop environments.

## Key Features and Goals

- **Performance-Optimized**: Built with performance in mind, BakalariDesktop is designed to handle caching, asynchronous requests, and other enhancements that make it faster than the web app.
- **Caching**: By caching data locally, BakalariDesktop allows users to quickly access previously viewed data, even without a live connection, significantly reducing loading times.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: The appâ€™s asynchronous architecture keeps tasks running smoothly in the background, ensuring a responsive and non-blocking user interface.
- **Custom Rendering with Skija**: Using Skija, BakalariDesktop achieves high-quality, GPU-accelerated rendering, delivering a visually rich and responsive experience that feels native on desktop.

## Why BakalariDesktop?

The official web interface of the Bakalari system can often be slow and restrictive, especially when used on less performant devices or slower networks. **BakalariDesktop** is designed to address these limitations by taking advantage of desktop-specific capabilities such as:

- **Advanced Caching**: Avoid redundant API requests by storing data locally for offline access and faster data retrieval.
- **Rich Custom Rendering**: With Skija as the rendering engine, the UI provides smooth animations and responsive interactions, free from the constraints of typical browser limitations.
- **Optimized Resource Management**: Leveraging desktop computing power, BakalariDesktop can manage memory and CPU resources more effectively than a browser, enhancing both speed and efficiency.
